# BAOBAB Protocol Security Suite 🛡️

A comprehensive suite of modular, smart-contract-based security tools designed to safeguard DeFi protocols. This system provides a robust defense-in-depth layer, protecting against market volatility, exploits, and denial-of-service attacks.

## ✨ Features

-   **Circuit Breaker**: Automatically halts trading during extreme price volatility, volume spikes, or liquidation cascades to protect user funds.
-   **Emergency Pauser**: A multi-level, role-based system (Guardian, Admin, Multisig) to pause the entire protocol or specific modules in response to threats.
-   **Rate Limiter**: Implements a token bucket algorithm to prevent DoS attacks and transaction spam on critical functions like order placement and withdrawals.
-   **Reentrancy Guard**: A foundational, non-reentrant modifier provided by `SecurityBase` to prevent common reentrancy exploits.
-   **Token Rescue**: A failsafe mechanism allowing a designated admin to recover any ERC20 tokens or ETH accidentally sent to the contract addresses.
-   **Modular & Inheritable**: Each security component is a distinct, abstract contract, designed for easy integration into any Solidity-based system.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)** | The core language for implementing the smart contract security logic on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). |
| **[OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts)** | Used for standard and secure interfaces like `IERC20` for token interactions. |
| **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)** | (Assumed) A professional Ethereum development environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project in a local development environment.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/BAOBAB-PROTOCOL.git
    cd BAOBAB-PROTOCOL
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    # or
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Compile Contracts**:
    Compile the smart contracts to check for errors and generate artifacts.
    ```bash
    yarn hardhat compile
    ```

4.  **Run Tests**:
    Execute the test suite to ensure all security modules function as expected.
    ```bash
    yarn hardhat test
    ```

## Usage

To integrate a security module, simply inherit it in your contract. For instance, to protect a contract with a reentrancy guard and rate limiting, you can do the following:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import {SecurityBase} from "./security/SecurityBase.sol";
import {RateLimiter} from "./security/RateLimiter.sol";

contract TradingEngine is SecurityBase, RateLimiter {

    constructor(address _admin) RateLimiter(_admin) {
        // Contract initialization logic
    }

    /**
     * @notice Places a new order, protected by rate limiting and a reentrancy guard.
     */
    function placeOrder()
        external
        nonReentrant // From SecurityBase
        rateLimited(keccak256("PLACE_ORDER")) // From RateLimiter
    {
        // Business logic for placing an order
        // ...
    }
}

```

In the example above, the `placeOrder` function is now protected against both reentrancy attacks and transaction spam, demonstrating the modular power of the security suite.
